I ordered the Miso Brown Butter Latte, and it exceeded all expectations—rich, balanced, and unlike anything I’ve tried at another NYC coffee shop.\n\nI also had the Nutella-filled banana bread, which was absolutely incredible. Moist, decadent, and full of flavor—one of the best pastries I’ve had in New York.\n\nThe seating area is a bit tight, but there’s still enough space to work, relax, and enjoy your coffee, which is a huge plus for anyone looking for a cozy spot in the city.\n\nIf you’re searching for great coffee, unique latte flavors, and amazing pastries in NYC, Joe Coffee is 100% worth the stop. Highly recommend!",

Then, when she poured the cinnamon into the cup, she blew the excess cinnamon off—health violation #2.\nThis was genuinely one of the most disgusting experiences I’ve ever had.

I asked for my coffee black, and right away she made a loud, sexually derogatory comment to her coworker. It felt unprofessional and uncomfortable in a public workspace.\n\nAfter getting my coffee, I asked another worker for half-and-half on the side so I could add it myself. I ended up with extra half-and-half and didn’t want to dump it into the small trash bin at the counter, so I politely asked if they could take it. The same barista immediately gave me an attitude and told me to throw it away “around the corner.” I said I didn’t see a trash can, and instead of helping, she stared me down and made additional derogatory remarks about me to her coworker within earshot.\n\nThat kind of hostility and disrespect is not what I expect from Blue Bottle, especially at a place I’ve supported so consistently. I hope management addresses this, because no customer should be made to feel uncomfortable or mocked for a simple, polite request.",

If you’re dealing with a dietary requirement why would you argue with a customer?

The front of the shop has a small seating area while the length of the rest of the space adorns candles on the walls of the left side and the coffee counter on the right side.\nService: The ladies here are all business. They will get your order, make you drink well, and hand it to you within minutes. People were coming in and out, so their wait times are not bad at all considering how many people come through the door.\nMenu items: I got their Strawberry Shortcake Matcha with whole milk, and it was worth the $ spent. The matcha wasn't sweet (which I love), and the added strawberry puree and thick, creamy topping made the drink taste as good as it looked.\n\nI'll be recommending this spot to anyone I know visiting the city and will definitely be making my way back next time I'm up there!",

There is wifi, but you have to ask the staff for the password, which I would suggest placing it on a sign somewhere instead.

They have a creative, elevated basic menu. The store is clean and is very aesthetically pleasing. I also like that they have their blends on display.  You can tell the baristas are career baristas.\n\nHowever…. I’m sad to say this place is just not good. I’ve been a couple times, and tried to switch up my order a bunch, but I’ve regretted every time I went here. The black sesame chai (which sounds right up my alley) unfortunately tasted like teriyaki marinade, so salty and undrinkable. I tried their butterscotch latte, which tasted sour and honestly just like milk. I thought “okay, let me try oat milk which is thinner than milk so I can taste the espresso next time.” I got an oat milk vanilla date latte, and again it tasted like nothing but milk.\n\nI think their espresso needs to be way more robust and less watery… can’t say anything I’ve tasted from them had any coffee taste come through. And all this for 10$ a drink…? Yeah…. It’s a no from me dog :/",

From the moment we walked in, we were treated like regulars. The owner personally came by to welcome us and our waitress was attentive without being intrusive – you can tell the team genuinely cares about every guest.\n\nThe menu focuses on simple dishes executed perfectly with fresh, seasonal ingredients. We tried the shakshuka toast, French toast and avocado toast, and each dish was packed with flavor and beautifully presented. The seeded sourdough and whipped ricotta were standouts, and the coffee – sourced from an Australian boutique roaster – was one of the best cups I’ve had in NYC.\n\nEven though it was busy, everything ran smoothly and we never felt rushed. The atmosphere is bright, airy and relaxed – a perfect spot to catch up with friends, fuel up before exploring Hudson Yards or enjoy a laid‑back weekend brunch. Whether you’re a New Yorker looking for a new favorite cafe or a tourist wanting an authentic taste of the city’s brunch scene, this is a must-visit. We left feeling like part of the community and can’t wait to return. Five stars!",

It’s a nice café overall — most of the staff are friendly and the service is generally quick.\n\nHowever, I had stopped coming here for a while because of one particular barista (blond hair, blue eyes). The first time I ordered a drip coffee, he raised his voice at me saying, ‘What coffee do you want? We have espresso, we have filter,’ which was completely unnecessary. Another barista stepped in at that moment. As someone who has worked as a barista in Brooklyn for a long time, I’d say that when someone orders a ‘drip’ or simply says ‘coffee,’ it’s usually clear what they mean. Even if it wasn’t, raising his voice over a basic question wasn’t the right approach — I was literally just placing my order.\n\nOn another visit, the same barista took my payment and pressured me to leave a tip. I normally tip anyway, but I didn’t feel comfortable tipping someone whose service had already been unpleasant. I still tipped out of courtesy, but the pressure was really off-putting.\n\nLater, during another visit, he interrupted a conversation I was having with another barista and tried to stir up the interaction for no reason. At that point, it just felt like intentional discomfort. I didn’t even want to make eye contact — I just wanted to leave. It reached a ‘please stop bothering me’ level.\n\nFYI, lol.",
